# tokyo60-keymap

This is my keymap for my tokyo60 keyboard. I purchased it at [Drop](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-tokyo-keyboard-tokyo60-keyboard-kit).

## Some Notes

- The `Fn` key placement was really annoying to me, so I set up the Tab key to be `Tab` on tap or `Fn` on hold.
- I've used VIM on and off for 20 years now, so I mapped the arrow keys to `hjkl`. I use the line above those keys for `Home`, `End`, `Ctrl-->` and `Ctrl-<-`.
